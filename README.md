## üöÄ About The Project

This project is a comprehensive UI clone of the Pop!_OS landing page, developed as an exercise to demonstrate core frontend development skills. The primary goal was to turn a complex, professional design into a functional, elegant, and fully responsive solution using only fundamental web technologies.

The project emphasizes:
* **Semantic HTML5** for a well-structured and accessible foundation.
* **Modern CSS3**, including Flexbox, Grid, and Custom Variables for a maintainable and scalable stylesheet.
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for dynamic functionality, proving that powerful features can be built without dependency on heavy libraries.
* **A Mobile-First** responsive design workflow, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

* **HTML5:** For structuring the content and layout.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and animations.
    * **Flexbox:** For one-dimensional layout control (e.g., navigation bars, feature sections).
    * **Grid:** For two-dimensional layout control (e.g., card-based sections).
    * **Custom Variables:** For a centralized and maintainable theme (colors, fonts).
    * **Media Queries:** For building a fully responsive design.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactive and dynamic features.
    * **DOM Manipulation:** To control classes and elements for interactivity.
    * **Intersection Observer API:** For performant scroll-based animations.

### User Interaction Flowchart

This flowchart demonstrates the primary user flows and the logic handled by the CSS and JavaScript.

```mermaid

    A[Start: Page Loads] --> B{Is screen width < 999px?};
    
    B -- Yes --> C[Mobile View];
    B -- No --> D[Desktop View];
    
    C --> E{User taps hamburger icon};
    E -- Toggle --> F[Mobile Menu Slides In];
    F --> G{User taps a link or closes menu};
    G -- Toggle --> H[Mobile Menu Slides Out];
    
    D --> I{User scrolls down};
    I -- Check scroll position > 50px --> J[Sticky Header appears];
    I -- Element enters viewport --> K[Section fades in];
    
    D --> L{User clicks slider arrows};
    L -- Update slide index --> M[Testimonial slide changes];
    
    H --> Z[End Interaction];
    J --> Z;
    K --> Z;
    M --> Z;
